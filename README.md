# nixos-nord-wallpapers-fade

Using the wallpapers from @OulipianSummer to have a slightly animated background. The concept is to slowly transition between images and have a different logo light up randomly.

To be used with [wpaperd](https://github.com/danyspin97/wpaperd) or similar to fade between images.
